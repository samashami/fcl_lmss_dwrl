FCL-LMSS experiments on the DWRL dataset.
This repository contains the codebase for Federated Continual Learning (FCL) experiments on the DWRL plastic waste dataset.
The project focuses on vision-based plastic classification under non-IID, streaming data conditions and compares:
(1) a fixed FCL baseline,
(2) a heuristic controller (V4),
and (3) an LLM-guided policy controller (LMSS).

The DWRL dataset is private and not included in this repository.
Only preprocessing logic, training pipelines, and evaluation code are provided.
